.question
  %h4 Who makes SaltyBot?
  The inital idea was by me, and
  %a{href: "https://github.com/firestack", target: "_blank"} Firestack
  joined on shortly after when I was
  trying to get help because I had no idea what I was doing.  She has rewritten
  the entire bot probably 3 times at this point, which is why it can be run on
  a server and be in multiple channels.

.question
  %h4 Why do we need your email?
  Short answer: If you are that paranoid then you shouldn't have even set an email in Twitch.
  Long Answer: Email is the least amount of info that we can request from twitch to verify your account.

.question
  %h4 How do I get a custom name for the bot?
  First of all you need to own the account that you want the name of.  Then you will need to generate
  and oauth token for the bot account
  %a{href: "http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi/", target: "_blank"} here
  Once you have that insert the bot's username and oauth into the settings page.  If there is any
  problems with it then the corresponding error messages will be displayed.  Once you have set the custom
  name and the oauth checks out, you will not need to enter the oauth anymore even though the field is blank.

.question
  %h4 Why doesn't X work?
  Most likely because I don't know that it isn't working correctly.  I don't have a way
  to test most things by myself extensively.  Join the IRC channel and let me know what's
  up if anything behaves incorrectly.

.question
  %h4 How are quotes selected?
  As randomly as possible.  We use a random sample of 2 quotes from all that are reviewed,
  and only take the second if the first was used last.  So I guess it has the chance to not
  be completely random.

.question
  %h4 Why doesn't !song work?
  Technically it does, and I can help you set it up if you really want to use it.  The problem
  is I haven't found a good program to POST data to any website for osu, but if you want to use
  it for just general purpose songs and you have a program that can do it I won't stop you.

.question
  %h4 What's with the weird URL ._.
  I like it and think it's nice, get over it you nerd .-.

.question
  %h4 How can I get support?
  Join #saltybot on the freenode network on IRC.  Someone will be there that can provide help (hopefully).
