Running locally for SaltyBot
============================
###Set the following config variables
`salty_client_id` This is the client id associated with the twitch application.
`salty_client_secret` This is the secret key associated with the twitch application.
`salty_ip_address` This is the IP that the python bot is running on used to auto update.
`salty_web_secret` This should be the same as the web secret in python bot config file.

Clone the repo, and run

If something does not work correctly submit an issue so I can fix it.
